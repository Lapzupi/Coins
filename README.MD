# Modified Coins Version
If you somehow stumbled on this fork, this version is different from the upstream in a couple of ways.
It has 2 additional soft-depends: ItemsAdder & Nova.

* Supports ItemsAdder materials for the coin material.
* Registers a nova protection integration to prevent coin duping via the vacuum chest.
* Requires Java 17


# Coins
Configurable lightweight coins for killing and mining, with a withdraw system and perfect for drop parties.
